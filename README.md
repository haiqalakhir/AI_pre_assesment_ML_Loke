I tried 3 versions..

Code1: not using panda library & not using define function.. however using lambda which is quite advanced

Code2: using panda library but not using define function.. still using lambda

Code3: using panda library & define function.. more complex code, but more 'clean' code.. 

1st & 2nd version genarate output as attached below:
